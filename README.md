### Installation:
simply download "yt-dlp_GUI.pyw" and run it. 
__The only prerequisite required is python itself;__ the GUI script will install dependancies on its own if they aren't already present.

### Usage:
* Links:
  
  * Links can be entered from any site that is supported by yt-dlp.  
    Only youtube and (most) spotify links get the cool previews tho.

* Configuration:
  
  * In "Auto" mode, you can choose between downloading just Audio or Audo+Video.
    In "Manual" mode, you can select a codec and a quality.
  * Additional configuration options are present in the settings.

### Missing features:
* no error messages on failure
* light theme looks abysmally terrible
* proper progress tracking is non existant
